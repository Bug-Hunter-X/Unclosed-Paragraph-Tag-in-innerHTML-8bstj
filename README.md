# Unclosed Paragraph Tag in innerHTML

This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug related to using `innerHTML` to update the content of a div element. The bug is caused by an unclosed paragraph tag within the new content, leading to unexpected behavior.  The solution provides a corrected version.

**Bug:** The original `bug.html` file includes an unclosed `<p>` tag when using `innerHTML`. This will often lead to unexpected visual results or complete page rendering failure. 

**Solution:** The `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected code with the closing `</p>` tag.
